Note: drawing from https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-w-keras-openai-dqns-1eed3a5338c 
As example DQN model. Note modifications required to draw this from the Gym format. 
Alternate option considered: creating a custom gym environment using the simulator. 

Design principle: 
    - all information passed to the agent should be in vector / matrix form 
    - no inheritance from simulator class - keep the environments separate  
    - main difficulty may be deciding how to pass the observation / action spaces to the agent 
    
Initial model: 
    - No prioritised experience replay, only simple experience replay
